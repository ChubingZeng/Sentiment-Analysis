# Sentiment Analysis for 400,000 Amazon Reviews

## Description 
In this project, the goal is to perform sentiment analysis to determine whether a review is positive or negative. 
I implemented 3 different machine learning algorithms to build text classifiers for Amazon reviews. The three algorithms are: neural networks (LSTM to be specific), decision tree and Naive Bayes. 
## Dataset 
The data I'm using comes from the Kaggle Amazon review competition: https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews
## Analysis Result
Please refer to the *.py* files for my code, and *analysis report.pdf* for detailed description of how I pre-processed the data, built up the models and compared the performance of the three methods. 

In this 5-min video, I described in detail the dataset, preprocesssing, classifications, results and discussion of the problem.
