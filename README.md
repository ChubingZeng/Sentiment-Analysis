# Sentiment Analysis for 400,000 Amazon Reviews

## Description 
In this project, I implemented 3 different machine learning algorithms to build text classifiers for Amazon reviews. The three algorithms are: neural networks (LSTM to be specific), decision tree and Naive Bayes. 
## Dataset 
The data I'm using comes from Kaggle Amazon review sentiment analysis: https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews
This dataset is an extract from the Amazon Reviews Kaggle competition. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis to determine whether a review is positive or negative. We have provided a CSV file on D2L which contains the binary label (positive/negative) and the corresponding text for the 400,000 reviews.
